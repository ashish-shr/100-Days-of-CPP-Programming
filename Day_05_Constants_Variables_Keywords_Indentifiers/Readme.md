# âš¡Constants, Variables, Keywords and Identifiers

## Constants

- Constants are the fixed values i.e. we cannot changed their values during the execution of the program.
- Constants can be of majorly two types i.e. numeric constant and character constant.
- Numeric constants includes integers such as 0, -2, 30 etc., and real/floating point values such as 1.1, 3.14 etc.
- Character constants includes character written in single quote ('') such as 'A', '#' etc., and string constants includes characters written in double quote ("") such as "Lambda", "a" etc.
- We can declare constants using const keyword or #define for a macro.
- Structure: const variable_name; | #define variable_name value

## Variables

- Variables are the name given to a memory location where we store the data.
- The values of a variable can be changed during the execution of the program.
- Variables are declared using various naming convention.
- Variables are of three types i.e. Local, Instance and Static variables.
- Local variables are defined within a block, method or constructor.
- Instance variables are defined in a class outside of any method.
- Static variables are the class variables declared using static keyword within a class.
- Structure: datatype variable_name;

## Identifiers

- Identifiers are the name given to variables, functions, arrays, classes etc.
- The naming convention for identifiers are same as variables.
- Also, there are pre-defined identifiers which are the name predefined such as include, iostream, cout, main etc.

## Naming convention for Variables and Identifiers

- They should contain letters (a-z/A-Z), digits (0-9) or underscore( \_ ).
- They are case-sensitive i.e. lowercase and uppercase are two different things.
- The name should start with a letter (a-z/A-Z) or underscore( \_ ).
- No whitespaces and use of special characters are allowed (except underscore).
- Keywords cannot be used for naming.

## Keywords

- Keywords are the words which are reserved or predefined.
- Keywords always starts in lowercase.
- They defines the type of entity.
- Unlike identifiers, no special symbols, punctuations are used in keywords.
- Some keywords are int, char, while, do etc.
