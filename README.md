# 100-Days of C++ Programming ðŸš€

## Overview

I am excited to embark on a 100-day journey of learning C++ Programming! ðŸŽ‰ Throughout this period, I will be mastering C++ Programming, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced concepts. I have outlined a comprehensive curriculum that covers a wide range of topics, ensuring a solid understanding of this versatile language.

## Topics Covered

- **What is OOP?** Understanding the fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming and its significance in modern software development.
- **Structure of CPP Programs:** Grasping the layout and organization of C++ programs to build robust and scalable applications.
- **Data types, variables, keywords, and identifiers:** Laying the foundation with essential building blocks of C++.
- **Operators and control structures:** Gaining control over the flow of programs with decision-making and loop constructs.
- **Functions and inline functions:** Learning to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units for efficient coding.
- **Function overloading:** Exploring the powerful technique of writing multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
- **Classes, Objects, Constructor, and Destructor:** Unraveling the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, a paradigm widely used in real-world applications.
- **Types of Constructors:** Mastering the various forms of constructors to initialize objects effectively.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Understanding the relationships between classes and leveraging the ability to write flexible and reusable code.
- **Friend function and Friend class:** Exploring unique relationships between functions and classes that transcend encapsulation boundaries.
- **Pointer and Virtual Function:** Getting hands-on with memory management and dynamic polymorphism.
- **Virtual Classes:** Delving deeper into the concepts of virtual classes for creating hierarchies of classes.
- **File management:** Learning to read from and write to files, is a crucial aspect of data handling in applications.
- **Exception handling:** Gaining the skills to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully and ensuring robustness.
- **Templates and STL:** Unleashing the power of generic programming and understanding the Standard Template Library for efficient coding.
