## Recursion and Recursive function

- A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this technique is known as recursion.
- It uses the method of dividing the program into sub-tasks and calling it repeatedly instead of the iterative method which takes lots of time to solve the same problem.
- As the recursive function calls itself continuously, it is always possible that the program goes into an infinite loop.
- So, the most important thing about the recursion is it should have the base case to terminate the recursion.

## Syntax:

Below is the working of recursion in C++:

```cpp
  void recursion()
  {
    recursion();
  }

  int main()
  {
    recursion();
  }
```
