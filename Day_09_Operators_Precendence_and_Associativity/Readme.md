# âš¡Operators Precedence and Associativity in C++

## Operators Precedence

If there are multiple operators in a single expression, the operations are not evaluated simultaneously. Rather, the operators with higher precedence or priority have their operations evaluated first.

## Operators Associativity

Operator associativity is the direction from which an expression is evaluated.

#### Note: Similarly, the order of evaluation depends on the compiler and the program may show undefined behaviour in case of evaluation of expression having increment and decrement operator.
